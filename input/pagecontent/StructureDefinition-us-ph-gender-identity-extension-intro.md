This represents an individualâ€™s identity, ascertained by asking them what that identity is. In the case where the gender identity is communicated by a third party, for example, if a spouse indicates the gender identity of their partner on an intake form, a Provenance resource can be used with a Provenance.target referring to the Patient, with a targetElement extension identifying the gender identity extension as the target element within the Patient resource. When exchanging this concept, refer to the guidance in the [Gender Harmony Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/xprod/ig/uv/gender-harmony/).
