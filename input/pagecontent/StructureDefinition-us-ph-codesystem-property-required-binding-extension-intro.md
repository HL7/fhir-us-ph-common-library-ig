When a CodeSystem in FHIR defines properties that can be associated with codes in the code system, this extension can be used to establish a required binding to a ValueSet to specify the allowable values for the property. For example, a CodeSystem that defined a "us-state" property could use this binding to specify that the allowable values for that property are limited to the set of valid postal codes for US states.
