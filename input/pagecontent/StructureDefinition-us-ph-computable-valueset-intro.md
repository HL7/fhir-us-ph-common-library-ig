It is based on the [US Public Health ValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-ph-valueset.html) and describes a computable value set as one that **SHALL** have an expression-based definition (i.e. a value set defined intensionally using expressions of the code systems involved) and MAY have an expansion included. The expression-based definition **SHALL** be represented in only one of three ways; using the compose element, using the expression extension, or using the rules-text extension to provide a step-by-step process for expanding the value set definition.
